# Hejsa ðŸ‘‹

My name is Frank, and I'm a developer from Denmark. "Hejsa" means Hi in Danish.

I've coded since I was ten years old when I got my first computer (Commodore 64). In the beginning, I struggled with the concept of nesting and scopes. These days I'm fascinated by serverless backend architectures, [Flutter][flutter], [GraphQL][graphql].

At my current employer, [Forecast][forecast], we try to create the best [PSA][psa] tool using Java, [MySQL][mysql], [React][react], [GraphQL][graphql], NodeJS and [Serverless][serverless]. All running on [AWS][aws]. My role as Senior Developer gives me plenty of challenges such as defining and implementing Continious Deployment, Automated Testing, Component Libraries and more...

For me, it is extremely important to ensure the best developer experience for everyone, so it is both fun to work with the code and also make it easier to produce better results in less time. I base it both on what I have experienced so far myself and also draw inspiration from others:

- Ensuring easy-to-use project setups. It should be as easy as possible to get a local development environment up and running
- Automated rule-checking over manual checklists (f.ex. [ESLint][eslint] and [SonarQube][sonarqube])
- Use good practices for having a good code structure. This means ensuring code is divided into small files and that the files are grouped in a logical and easy-to-navigate fashion.
- Regarding the code itself, I try to use well-established best practices unless there is a specific reason not to. Here I normally fall back to [OOP][oop], [Design Patterns][designpatterns], [Clean Code][cleancode] and others.
